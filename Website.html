        <h2>Part 1: Categories of Voters by Voting Frequency</h2>
        <p class="visualization-text">Visualization 1: This plot shows the level of education and income distribution for three kinds of voters categorized by their voting frequency (always, sporadic, or rarely/never). This graph shows that most participants in the sample reported voting sporadically. Moreover, many of the most frequent voters may come from the lower class, and the middle and upper class are less likely to participate in their country’s political scene by voting. This phenomenon may have important implications for election outcomes and policy decisions.</p>

        <h2>Part 2: Percentage of Absentee Votes and Total Vote Turnout in Virginia Regions</h2>
        <p class="visualization-text">Visualization 2: This plot shows the percentage of absentee votes and the total voting turnout rate in all Virginia counties in five state or presidential election years (2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022). In the two presidential election years (i.e. 2016 and 2020), significant increases in voting turnout can be observed. Moreover, absentee votes were significantly higher in 2020 than in all other years, perhaps due to the limit of in-person voting during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

        <h2>Part 3: Map of Voter Turnout Distribution in Virginia Counties</h2>
        <p class="visualization-text">Visualization 3: This plot shows the vote turnout rate in all Virginia counties in 2022. Overall, the middle and eastern parts of Virginia tend to have a higher turnout rate, while the turnout rate declines when moving to the southern and western parts of Virginia As displayed in the visualization, the dark purple cities and counties had turnout rates much higher than other areas in the state, with 60% or more of residents turning out to vote. Areas shaded with blue, light blue, and white have much lower turnout rate than the state total, less than 48%, mostly in Virginia’s southwestern and Southside counties.</p>
